<p class="binderItem"><strong>Second Viennese School</strong><br/>The second Viennese school is a group of composers surrounding Arnold Schoenberg, mostly his pupils.  Composers such as Webern and Berg was heavily influenced by the composing techniques and style of Schoenberg and carried on to their own interests in composition.  Furthermore, it can be considered the beginning of atonality, which later influenced the whole trend of art music later in the twentieth century.  On the other hand, the second Viennese school can be considered directly inheriting the...</p>

<br/>
Early Schoenberg's piece before op. 10 applied Wagnerian leitmotiv, contrapuntal chord progression, and avoid tonal resolutions.  Also Schoenberg was influenced by German romantic naturalism tradition of acoustic effects and chord progressions.  In the mean time, the style of "developing motifs", gradual variation of motive in a music piece for self similarity, came form Brahms.<br/>

The progress of Schoenberg's composition interests was focused on developing motifs rather than establish tona...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Anton Webern</strong><br/>Webern's early pieces followed Schoenberg's steps including Wagnerian leitmotiv and developing variation, and later free atonality.  Besides Schoenberg, another influence of Webern is Mahler's chamber idea of orchestration, naturalism and Wunderhorn-like folk-religious contents.  This influence is shown in Webern's songs.<br/>
<br/>
Another influence being carried from Schoenberg and later became Webern's signature style is the idea of klangfarbenmelodie.  From Mahler's idea of chamber music orchestration...</p>
