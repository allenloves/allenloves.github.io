\f0\fs28 \cf0 The second Viennese school is a group of composers surrounding Arnold Schoenberg, mostly his pupils.  Composers such as Webern and Berg was heavily influenced by the composing techniques and style of Schoenberg and carried on to their own interests in composition.  Furthermore, it can be considered the beginning of atonality, which later influenced the whole trend of art music later in the twentieth century.  On the other hand, the second Viennese school can be considered directly inheriting the tradition of German romanticism and style.\
