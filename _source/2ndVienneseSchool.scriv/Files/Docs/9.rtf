\f0\fs28 \cf0 Berg took Schoenberg's class together with Webern.   Besides Schoenberg influences, Berg has been attracted to the music of French impressionists, parallelism and linear approach of chord progression.   The other influence to Webern is Mahler, his chamber grouping of orchestra and folk songs. }
