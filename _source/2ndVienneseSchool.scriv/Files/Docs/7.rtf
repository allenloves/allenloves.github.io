\f0\fs28 \cf0 Webern's early pieces followed Schoenberg's steps including Wagnerian leitmotiv and developing variation, and later free atonality.  Besides Schoenberg, another influence of Webern is Mahler's chamber idea of orchestration, naturalism and Wunderhorn-like folk-religious contents.  This influence is shown in Webern's songs.\
\
Another influence being carried from Schoenberg and later became Webern's signature style is the idea of klangfarbenmelodie.  From Mahler's idea of chamber music orchestration, Webern's klangfarben style focuses on the nuance of timbre changes.\
