\f0\fs28 \cf0 Modern music synthesis-composition language environments are deeply influenced by the concept of Max Mathew's MUSIC-N series.   In the Music-N system, a library of functions called unit generators (UGens, or opcodes) are built around signal processing and synthesis routines.  Then an instrument can be defined by constructing different UGens.   Then, another score file contains information such as frequency, duration, amplitude and others to generate the music piece.\
\
Overall, the MUSIC-N model is still the basic concept among all different sound synthesizing/composing programming languages.  Due to limitation of the computation power from early computers, MUSIC-N did not provide real time performing or support MIDI when it was developed.  However as the computation power has been improved exponentially, most of computer synthesizing programming environments now support both MIDI and OSC controls for live and interactive performances.}
