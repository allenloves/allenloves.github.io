\f0\fs28 \cf0 Chuck is a strongly time based audio programming language for real time synthesis, composition and performance by Ge Wang in 2003.  Chuck programming language is loosely C like but in a concurrent scheme, which means the output of a function is on the right side of code.  The benefit of this programming design is to be able to create a stream of functions quickly with less codes. Besides unit generators, Chuck also provides unit analyzers for research and feature extractions.\
\
The down side of Chuck is in it's real time based programming environment. It does not separate sampling rate of audio and controlling signals.  Even though it makes coding a lot easier and faster it sacrifices the computing power of your system.  Chuck has been criticized for being unstable as a programming environment. }
