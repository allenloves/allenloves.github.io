\f0\fs28 \cf0 Both Max/MSP and Pure Data was developed by Miller Puckette.  He developed Max in the mid-80s in IRCAM to provide composers with an graphic programming interface for interactive computer music.  Later because of disagreeing of the decision of Max became a closed system, Puckette released an redesigned an open sourced version called Pure Data in 1996.  Despite some minor difference between these two, they are very similar from each other.\

Max and pd are both graphic programming environments.  All UGens and functions are designed to be an object boxes with inlets and outlets for users to achieve high level programming by patching those objects.  }
