\f0\fs28 \cf0 Impromptu is a programming environment designed for live coding by Andrew Sorensen in 2006.  It also contains sound synthesis modules and unit generators.  Sound modules, variables and functions can be redefined and changed to take effect immediately.  There is also scheduling in Scheme for composers to code events to be executed on distinated time. Furthermore it can work as a host of plug-in AU instruments and use them for audio synthesis and effects.  It also allows users to directly program for videos with live coding.\
\
The language used in Impromptu is based on Scheme.  In order to solve the typing speed problems, Impromptu has functions for pasting pre determined texts to shorten typing time.  \
\
Impromptu is designed for live coding audio and video and being executed and changed in real time.  The program written in Impromptu can not be compiled onto other platforms.}
