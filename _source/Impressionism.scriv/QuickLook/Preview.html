<p class="binderItem"><strong>Debussy</strong><br/>Early Debussy's works are influenced by Chabrier, Fauré, and of course, Wagner.  Debussy went to Bayreuth in 1888 and 1889.  In his Ariettes Oubliées, lots of chromatic chord progressions, 9th chords, dominant chord extensions demonstrated Wagner influences.  Other piece in this period includes Cinq poemes de Charles Baudelaire.<br/>
<br/>
In 1891 Debussy met Satie and started his path to "break away with Wagner".  Also started to be under the influence of "parallelism" from Satie.  Under his influence he...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Ravel</strong><br/>Besides under influence of Debussy and his music, Chabrier and early French composers are also influential to him.  Ravel's music was also influenced by other sources, such as Russian composers like Stravinsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, Spanish (maybe muslim culture included) music, Greek and Hebrew melodies.<br/>
<br/>
Compare to Debussy, Ravel composed more music based on traditional forms.  Such as Sonatine, Piano Concerto, and baroque music forms such as Minuet, Gavotte, Pavan and others.</p>
