\f0\fs28 \cf0 Satie went to Schola Cantorum to study counterpoint.  His piece was influenced by medieval music styles including parallelism, and Dadaism.  During 1900-1013, Satie's music emphasizes a new simplicity, technically easy, light texture, simple and direct music suitable for children.  His music was highly cultivated in caf\'e9 concert and modern cabaret in Paris.  In this period the cabaret culture also influenced most musicians in Paris including Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky, and  Les Six.\
\
Alone with the cabaret culture, Satie argues contrast to Wagnerian, Mahlerian, Expressionism, Primitivism, or Debussian styles.  His music has little witness and charming, but it lakes development.  It's been called "new simplicity".\
\
Satie's idea has big impact to people around him.(why?)  Besides French contemporaries, Stravinsky has also composed under the thought of new simplicity.}
