\f0\fs28 \cf0 During 1920, Cocteau wrote a ballet *Les marri\'e9s de la Eiffel* which introduced "Les Six" to the public.  The music of this ballet was rejoined by Cocteau to be composed by "Les Six" composers (Durey declined).  Each part of the ballet is composed separately by a composer.\
\
Cocteau advised French art to be free from German (precisely Wagnerian) domination, Debussian impressionism , or Russian pagan context.  Cocteau distrusted complexity of all such music.  Therefore the style of Satie's new simplicity and styles from young composers under Satie's influences appeals to him.  The ballet *Les marri\'e9s de la Eiffel* is his response to his ideal French art form.\
\
The Term "Les Six" is from an article published by Henri Collet in *Comoedia*.   Cocteau, as their spokesman and Satie as their spiritual leader, "Les Six" becomes a stream of "new spirit" of French music.}
