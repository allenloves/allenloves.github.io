<p class="binderItem"><strong>Formal Structure of Schoenberg's Verklärte Nacht op. 4</strong><br/><br/>
Schoenberg early piece such as *Verklärte Nacht* op. 4, composed in 1899, was under influences of Wagner's style such as  tonal complexity and leitmotif.<br/>
<br/>
This program music is based on a poem from Richard Dehmel, about a couple walking under the moon, and the woman revealed to the man about her  pregnancy before they met.  And the man opened his arm to love her and her new child.  The poem was divided into five sections and has an A-B-A'-C-A'' form in it's text. <br/>
<br/>
Even though this piece is pro...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Former Studies</strong><br/>Besides Schoenberg's own description and motivic analyze about this piece.  It has also been discussed and analyzed for several times.  According to a DMA thesis from Kirk Gustafson, major sources of analysis, especially in early twentieth century are romantically descriptions.  Among those previous studies, there are two detailed analyses in English provided by Walter Frisch and Richard Swift.<br/>
<br/>
Frisch's analyse, influenced by Egon Wellesz and Karl Dahlhaus, focused on the relationship of the mu...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Observation</strong><br/>In his own article analyzing Verklärt Nacht, Schoenberg has pointed out two major structural anchors: mm. 229 as a breakpoint, and mm. 370 as coda.  Acoustically, the overall formal design from the poem can be seen as a d minor to D major transfiguration, based on the mood of "despair - released" in Dehmel's poem.  Therefore the modulation to D major in mm. 229 marks a obvious section point in this piece.   In the first section, Schoenberg applied a lot of unstable chords such as sequenced half-...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Frisch's analyse</strong><br/>In Frisch's book, he has made a detailed analysis into themes and motives in Verklärte Nacht and revealed the relationship in between each themes.  Later in this article I will use Frisch's numbering system to indicate motives.<br/>
<br/>
![Frisch's Analyze of motives](../images/ft5t1nb3gn_00039.gif) <br/>
<br/>
There are two theme elements has been missed in Frisch's analyze.  The first one is revealed at mm. 138:<br/>
<br/>
![motive 4a'](../images/motive4aa.png)<br/>
<br/>
This motive can be observed as a variation of embellished mo...</p>

<br/>
For the first A section, even though there is an authentic cadence by mm. 29, the motive 2a and 2b followed after this cadence was never functioned independently from previous group 1a, 1b, and 1c as formal sections.  On the other hand, authentic cadences were seldom used as breakpoints in the first section of this piece.  Furthermore, Schoenberg has indicated the story of the second stanza as motive 3a.  Therefore it makes more sense to consider motive group 1 and 2 to...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/><br/>
The developing motive variation technique and fractal essence of formal design in Schoenberg's *Verklärte Nacht* makes it difficult to define a consensual formal analysis among music theorists.  The formal ambiguity allows it's audiences to perceive the music in different dimensions, or concentrate on the mood composer provided for the poem.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Schoenberg has mentioned this piece can be appreciated as absolute music, the letimotiv, development, and the tonal scheme of this piece has s...</p>
