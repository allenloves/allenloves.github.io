At the end of 1963, American innovator Robert  Arthur "Bob" Moog combined a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and amplifier module (VCA) with a keyboard and created the first prototype of a voltage controlled synthesizer.  He also developed other modules such as LFO, ADSR, VCF, RM, Mixer, Sequencer, S&H, and Custom control inputs.  Users can use patch cables to combine, control and modulate different modules as they want to create sounds.  Later in 1971, Moog began to produce Minimoog, Model D, a widely available, portable and relatively affordable model of moog synthesizers, although it is not able to connect the modules freely.\

Moog Synthesizer was used by several composers and in pop music.  Famous composer and producers include John Cage, Wendy Carlos, and Beatles.}
