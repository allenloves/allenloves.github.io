<p class="binderItem"><strong>Early Synthesizers</strong><br/>*Teleharmonium, 1906*<br/>
<br/>
The first electronic instrument was invented by Thaddeus Cahill called Telharmonium presented in 1906.  It was build with multiple gears called tone wheels with pickup coils to create electronic currents.  Sound timbres are created additively with overtones.  It can create multiple notes siamotainously.  The Teleharmonium was presented to the public was piped into the telephone system to provide address system.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Moog Modular Synthesizer</strong><br/>Transistor became available around 1947-1948, it has made possible for electronic instrument to be built smaller, portable and more accurate to control.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of 1963, American innovator Robert  Arthur "Bob" Moog combined a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and amplifier module (VCA) with a keyboard and created the first prototype of a voltage controlled synthesizer.  He also developed other modules such as LFO, ADSR, VCF, RM, Mixer, Sequencer, S&H, and Custom control inputs.  Users can ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Digital Synthesizers</strong><br/>The first digital music language using a computer to generate sounds was MUSIC-I, MUSIC-II...., to MusicN, developed by Max Mathews at 1960s.  Due to the limit of processing speed of computers in that time, MUSIC-N systems was not able to create or perform sounds in real time.  Sounds has to be compiled with a score before it can be played back.<br/>
<br/>
Using a general purposed computer to create sounds has it's own limit of processing power.  Therefore it is necessary to create a specialized computer ...</p>
