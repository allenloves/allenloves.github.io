\f0\fs28 \cf0 Lecturer of Multimedia Art, Color Theory and Modern Life, Introduce of Digital Art and Recording Engineering in Center of General Education & Core Curriculum. There are about 70 students each semester.  For general education, I opened many kinds of courses like \'93Multimedia Art\'94, \'93Introduction of Digital Art\'94, \'93Color and Life\'94 and \'93Digital Audiovisual Art\'94 and etc..  The purpose is to introduce the concept and basic knowledge of digital multimedia to students not major in these area. In2002, Tamkang built a high standard concert hall with a well equipped recording and video producing studio.  However it were not easy to find proper human resource to operate those equipments.  Therefore I start to train students to operate those equipments in my \'93Digital Audiovisual Art\'94 course.  After a semester, students will understand the basic concept of patching in studio.  Then they can start internship in the concert hall.  Now these students are available to operate audio and video recording systems in music concert, drama performance, lectures and other activities in the concert hall.\
