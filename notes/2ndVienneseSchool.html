					<h1 id="second-viennese-school">Second Viennese School</h1>

<p>The second Viennese school is a group of composers surrounding Arnold Schoenberg, mostly his pupils.  Composers such as Webern and Berg was heavily influenced by the composing techniques and style of Schoenberg and carried on to their own interests in composition.  Furthermore, it can be considered the beginning of atonality, which later influenced the whole trend of art music later in the twentieth century.  On the other hand, the second Viennese school can be considered directly inheriting the tradition of German romanticism and style.</p>

<p>Therefore, to understand the origin of second Viennese school and how he reach the point of atonality, it is crucial to understand the creative progression of early Schoenberg.</p>

<h1 id="arnold-schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</h1>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Early Schoenberg’s piece before op. 10 applied Wagnerian leitmotiv, contrapuntal chord progression, and avoid tonal resolutions.  Also Schoenberg was influenced by German romantic naturalism tradition of acoustic effects and chord progressions.  In the mean time, the style of “developing motifs”, gradual variation of motive in a music piece for self similarity, came form Brahms.</p>

<p>The progress of Schoenberg’s composition interests was focused on developing motifs rather than establish tonal scheme.  Therefore gradually from stepwise progression or chromatic shifting of chords, Schoenberg abandoned the tendency of “resolving” in the tonal scheme.  By focusing on variation of developing motifs, Schoenberg started to adapt non triads into his harmonic system and finally crossed the line to atonality.</p>

<p>According to Morgan, there is no definite line in between tonal and atonal in Schoenberg’s early pieces.  Some suggested the last piece of second String Quartet op. 10, without key signature, can be considered his first atonal piece.  However even in Klavierstüke op. 11, the bass in the second piece still suggested a D minor consistency.  It will be better to understand that Schoenberg is more focused on free variations of motifs and counterpoints rather than the question of “crossing the line of tonality”.</p>

<h1 id="anton-webern">Anton Webern</h1>

<p>Webern’s early pieces followed Schoenberg’s steps including Wagnerian leitmotiv and developing variation, and later free atonality.  Besides Schoenberg, another influence of Webern is Mahler’s chamber idea of orchestration, naturalism and Wunderhorn-like folk-religious contents.  This influence is shown in Webern’s songs.</p>

<p>Another influence being carried from Schoenberg and later became Webern’s signature style is the idea of klangfarbenmelodie.  From Mahler’s idea of chamber music orchestration, Webern’s klangfarben style focuses on the nuance of timbre changes.</p>

<h1 id="alban-berg">Alban Berg</h1>

<p>Berg took Schoenberg’s class together with Webern.   Besides Schoenberg influences, Berg has been attracted to the music of French impressionists, parallelism and linear approach of chord progression.   The other influence to Webern is Mahler, his chamber grouping of orchestra and folk songs.</p>
