<p>Les Six and Satie presented Neo Classicism after 1910s.  In music, it is a movement against the trend of music history to be more and more complex, which referred to German style domination.</p>

<p>In this period, writers and composers are also being influenced by Dadaism and Surrealism.  In music, themes and phrases reveals without transition.  The “happening” becomes a core idea of music writing.</p>

<p>A major place where composers, artists, writers gathered was cabaret in that time.  The cabaret style of lyricism and simplicity also influenced the choice of style among these composers.</p>

<h2 id="satie">Satie</h2>

<p>Satie went to Schola Cantorum to study counterpoint.  His piece was influenced by medieval music styles including parallelism, and Dadaism.  During 1900-1013, Satie’s music emphasizes a new simplicity, technically easy, light texture, simple and direct music suitable for children.  His music was highly cultivated in café concert and modern cabaret in Paris.  In this period the cabaret culture also influenced most musicians in Paris including Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky, and  Les Six.</p>

<p>Alone with the cabaret culture, Satie argues contrast to Wagnerian, Mahlerian, Expressionism, Primitivism, or Debussian styles.  His music has little witness and charming, but it lakes development.  It’s been called “new simplicity”.</p>

<p>Satie’s idea has big impact to people around him.(why?)  Besides French contemporaries, Stravinsky has also composed under the thought of new simplicity.</p>

<h2 id="les-six">Les Six</h2>

<p>During 1920, Cocteau wrote a ballet <em>Les marriés de la Eiffel</em> which introduced “Les Six” to the public.  The music of this ballet was rejoined by Cocteau to be composed by “Les Six” composers (Durey declined).  Each part of the ballet is composed separately by a composer.</p>

<p>Cocteau advised French art to be free from German (precisely Wagnerian) domination, Debussian impressionism , or Russian pagan context.  Cocteau distrusted complexity of all such music.  Therefore the style of Satie’s new simplicity and styles from young composers under Satie’s influences appeals to him.  The ballet <em>Les marriés de la Eiffel</em> is his response to his ideal French art form.</p>

<p>The Term “Les Six” is from an article published by Henri Collet in <em>Comoedia</em>.   Cocteau, as their spokesman and Satie as their spiritual leader, “Les Six” becomes a stream of “new spirit” of French music.</p>

<h3 id="poulenc">Poulenc</h3>

<p>Poulenc was largely self-taught in composition.  His early works displays spontaneity, charm, and simplicity in his style.  After Les Six was disbanded after 1921, Poulenc stays loyal to Cocteau’s manifesto.  Poulenc kept collaborate with Cocteau, and created pieces includes ballet and opera.</p>

<p>Poulenc’s late pieces (start from 1930), Roman Catholicism start to be a major influence of his composition.</p>
