*  Mathematical approach for pitch materials
	*  With constant interval contents
		*  1-5 (c, c#, f#, g, c), also related to Hungarian and Slovak songs.
		*  1-3 (c, c#, e, f, g#, a, c), Arabic influence.
		*  1-2, octatonic scale
	*  Golden section and Fibonacci series.
*  Overriding sense of tonality
	*  Modes
	*  Bitonality, with different key signatures.
	*  Harmony reinforced the interval content of his melodies
		*  Sometimes Clusters
*  Influence of eastern European folk songs

	Bartók seldom directly quote folk tune in his music, however he applied various essences of folk music styles into his music.

	* Rhythmic material
		*  Parlando-rubato style, assymmetrical beats
		*  Tempo giusto for regularized dance patterns.
		*  e.g. Allegro Barbaro
	*  Embellishment by glissando
