# DSP Programming in Faust

**A study note by Allen Wu**


# Introduction to Faust #

Faust (Functional Audio Stream) is a programming language designed for digital signal processing.  After programming in Faust, the compiler translates your Faust code into C++ code for further programming.  Furthermore, it provide several structure wrappers that generates programs for lots of popular environments and platforms such as Max/MSP, SuperCollider, Pure Data, iPhone, Android, VST, Audio Unit, stand along application, web application and more.

There are several benefits using Faust for DSP programming.  First, the Faust language is very easy and elegant, lots of complicated DSP algorithms would only need one line of code in Faust.
